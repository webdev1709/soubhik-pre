    <title>Why I like/dislike Mathematics?</title>
<body>
I like mathematics, due to many reasons.<br><br>
Primary reason: the encouragement provided by professors in our maths department<br><br>
Even though its tough with lectures often diverging away from my head ,but somehow me managing to stay present in those lectures and grinding through them forges my grade card well.<br><br>
Another reason is the mindset of opposing the common stereotype "maths is a very tough subject" that I've been hearing since childhood.
